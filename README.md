# 3. USING CONTAINER IN VM and adding nginx server by Docker

**First open aws search EC2 then Launch Instance and there select keypair in putty then download it**

**after that edit network setting and click on add security group rule and select TCP,UDP,ALL TRAFFIC AND SELECT EVERYWHERE SOURCE TYPE IN THEM then Launch it and run putty and paste public id on HOST NAME and open that downloaded key pair for putty in SSH then Auth then Credentials and open there**

**after that run it and write username as ubuntu as selected os and then type following commands**

```
**this will install and run docker in your vm**

```
newgrp docker
```
**this command will help us to use docker**

```
docker ps
```
**this will list docker**

```
docker --version
```
**this will display the version of docker installed**

### now installing nginx

```
docker pull nginx
```
**You can download Nginx from a pre-built Docker image, with a default Nginx configuration, by above command.
This downloads all the necessary components for the container.**

```
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```
**Nginx installed, you can configure the container so that itâ€™s publicly accessible as a web server.**

**run is the command to create a new container**

**The --name flag is how you specify the name of the container. If left blank, a generated name like nostalgic_hopper will be assigned.**

**-p specifies the port you are exposing in the format of -p local-machine-port:internal-container-port. In this case, you are mapping port :80 in the container to port :80 on the server.**

**nginx is the name of the image on Docker Hub.**


### now this will show this on your public ip

#### In your terminal, enter CTRL+C to stop the container from running.


```
docker ps -a
```
**verify the container status with this command**

```
docker rm docker-nginx
```
**Remove the existing  container**

```
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d nginx
```
**Create a new, detached Nginx container,By attaching the -d flag, you are running this container in the background.**


```
docker ps
```
**this will obtain info about your container**


```
docker stop docker-nginx
```
**Stop the container**


```
docker rm docker-nginx
```
**remove the container**


## Building a Web Page to Serve on Nginx


```
mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
```
**Create a new directory for your website content within the home directory**


```
cd ~/docker-nginx/html
```
**by this you navigate into this**


```
vi index.html
```
**now press i and write your code in html like**

```
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

```


```
docker rm docker-nginx
```
**to rebuild the container stop the container then remove it**

docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html -v ~/docker-nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf -d nginx
```
**This command links the custom website pages to the container.**




```
docker restart docker-nginx
